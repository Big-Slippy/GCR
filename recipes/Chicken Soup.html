        <p>Hereâ€™s a super basic, adaptable recipe for chicken soup. Use what you have on hand and feel free to adjust the ingredients and amounts to your liking!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Chicken:</strong> 1 whole chicken (or several chicken breasts)</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Roughly equal weight to the chicken; any vegetables you have (onions, carrots, celery are ideal, but anything works)</li>
            <li><strong>Aromatics (Optional):</strong> Old onions, carrots, celery, or any aromatic vegetables</li>
            <li><strong>Grains or Noodles (Optional):</strong> Dry noodles, rice, or any grains (remember, they expand during cooking)</li>
            <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Salt, pepper, turmeric (for color), and any other spices you like</li>
            <li><strong>Herbs and Acids (Optional):</strong> Fresh herbs (like parsley) for garnish, lemon juice or vinegar for a bit of acidity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Broth:
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the whole chicken in a large pot along with any giblets.</li>
                    <li>Add old or less-fresh aromatic vegetables like onions, carrots, or celery if available.</li>
                    <li>Cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the chicken is tender, about 1-2 hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>While the chicken is cooking, chop fresh vegetables into chunks.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that you use some form of onion. This adds a lot of flavor to the soup.</li>
                    <li>Remember that vegetables will shrink as they cook, so cut them slightly larger than your desired final size.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remove the Chicken and Strain the Broth:
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the chicken is tender, carefully remove it from the pot and set it aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Strain out any inedible solids from the broth and discard them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the chopped fresh vegetables to the strained broth along with a couple of pinches of salt.</li>
                    <li>Simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30-60 minutes. Add more water if needed to keep the vegetables submerged.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add Grains or Noodles (Highly Recommended):
                <ul>
                    <li>If using dry noodles, rice, or other grains, add them about 30 minutes before the soup is done.</li>
                    <li>Keep in mind that these will expand by 2-3 times. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shred the Chicken:
                <ul>
                    <li>While the vegetables are cooking, remove the meat from the cooled chicken.</li>
                    <li>Check and remove bones, cartilage, or other bits, then roughly chop or shred the chicken meat.</li>
                    <li>Add the shredded chicken back into the pot.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Season to Taste:
                <ul>
                    <li>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or spices as needed.</li>
                    <li>For a fresh flavor, add a splash of lemon juice or vinegar and stir in fresh herbs if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the soup hot and enjoy your customizable, hearty chicken soup!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
